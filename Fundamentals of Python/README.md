# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Key Features of Python:

- **Simple and Readable Syntax**: Python emphasizes readability and uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easy to learn and understand.
  
- **Dynamic Typing**: Python uses dynamic typing, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to it.
  
- **Interpreted and Interactive**: Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, making it easy to test code interactively using tools like IDLE or Jupyter Notebook.

- **Cross-platform**: Python is available on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for development.

- **Extensive Standard Library**: Python comes with a vast collection of libraries and modules for various tasks, ranging from web development to data analysis and scientific computing.

## Getting Started:

To start coding in Python, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Python is installed, you can write Python code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.

## Hello, World! Example:

```python
# This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
print("Hello, World!")
